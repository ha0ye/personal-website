# Goals for Data Analysis in R

Code that is:
* computationally reproducible (it gives the same answers each time you run it)

* easily runnable (it gives the same answers each time anyone else runs it)

* organized and documented so that *you* understand it

* easy to make (or *revert*) changes that your boss or reviewers request

* documented and reusable for someone else who wants to do something similar

---
# Set Up and Use RStudio

Make RStudio start R with an empty environment:
* `Tools -&gt; Global Options`
  - [ ] Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup
  - Save workspace to .RData on exit: *Never*

We set up RStudio this way in order to avoid issues with *hidden state*.

Briefly, *hidden state* are all the variables in the R environment that can affect calculations. Ideally, our code should produce the same output for the same input. For this reason, we want to reduce dependence on the *hidden state* and instead include that into our inputs.

---
# Use RStudio Projects and `here`

### RStudio projects:
* are equivalent to folders for code, data, documentation, etc.
* remember what files are open
* default to setting the working directory to the project folder (no need to set absolute paths)

### The `here` package:
* enables paths relative to the project folder regardless of what the working directory is (this is tricky because of how Rmarkdown and R can have different working directories)
* `here::here("data", "my_records.csv")` -&gt; `&lt;project folder&gt;/data/my_records.csv`

# Setup and use `usethis`

`usethis` is an R package to assist with workflows for project setup and development. It has a lot of useful features if you're writing R packages, and even if you're not.

Set up your user profile:
`usethis::edit_r_profile()`

```
options(
  usethis.name = "Jane Doe",
  usethis.description = list(
    `Authors@R` = 'person("Jane", "Doe", 
                          email = "jane@example.com", 
                          role = c("aut", "cre"), 
                          comment = c(ORCID = "####-####-####-####"))',
    License = "MIT + file LICENSE",
    Version = "0.0.0.9000"
  )
)
```

(If you don't have an ORCID yet, create [one](https://add_your_orcid_id)!)

# File and Folder Organization

Commonly used layouts help other people navigate your files. If you are consistent in using the same scheme, it also helps you navigate your files.

```
.
|--DESCRIPTION
|--README.md
|--LICENSE
|--data
| |--my_data.csv
|--analysis
| |--my_script.R
```

We can create a new package with `usethis::create_package("path/to/packageName")`.

See more examples in Wilson et al. 2017 and Marwick et al. 2018.

# Naming

Principles for naming files:
* machine readable
* human interpretable
* plays well with default ordering

Examples:
* `YYYY-MM-DD_bird-counts_site-A.csv`
* `YYYY-MM-DD_temperature-readings_site-B.csv`
* `&lt;category&gt;_&lt;sub-category&gt;_&lt;sub-sub-category&gt;`

See Jenny Bryan's [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)

# Version Control

*Back up your files in some way!*
Even storing your project folders in Google Drive or Dropbox is pretty good.

If you have the time and inclination, try Git (the software) and GitHub (the cloud platform).
Reasons:
* *de facto* standard for open source
* promotes collaboration
* it integrates into RStudio
* R markdown can render to `github_document`, which displays in a browser, e.g. https://github.com/ha0ye/R-demos/blob/master/rphylopic_plot.md

Where to learn Git and Github?
* the [software carpentry lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* the [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR book](http://happygitwithr.com/)

# Coding Tips

1. list package dependencies in a central location `usethis::use_package("&lt;package&gt;")`
2. use indentation, consistent variable names to format code
3. consider following a [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) and/or using a linter. (There is a linter built-into RStudio, but also the `lintr` package.)

---
# Workflow

After getting your code working, refactor it into a function:
* this avoids hidden state
* test and make sure it still works
* easy to call the function for yourself and others
* if desired, generalize the arguments (allows you to make changes easily)
* follows the DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle

---
# Building Your Analysis

You might go through multiple steps in your analysis, which can result in multiple different functions.

It can be convenient to save intermediate output, perhaps in an `output` or `results` folder. Then, you can load these objects instead of running long analyses each time.

R markdown can be a great way to format your results. Using intermediate objects can help avoid having to rerun everything whenever you re-knit the Rmarkdown. If you're using github, I recommend looking into `github_document` as an output type that renders easily within the web brwoser.

# Writing Functions to use Tidyverse

Suppose you want to write code to generalize operations that use tidyverse functions. The "typical" way of specifying function arguments doesn't work:
```
make_mtcars_plot &lt;- function(var1, var2)
{
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = var1, y = var2)) +
        geom_point()
}
make_mtcars_plot(cyl, disp) # gives me an error
make_mtcars_plot("cyl", "disp") # doesn't select the right columns to plot
```

The solution is to use special syntax to designate variables:
```
make_mtcars_plot_fixed &lt;- function(var1, var2)
{
    var1 &lt;- enquo(var1)
    var2 &lt;- enquo(var2)
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = !! var1, y = !! var2)) +
        geom_point()
}

make_mtcars_plot_fixed(cyl, disp)
```

# Documentation

Some general tips for documenting your code:

1. The code is already a representation of what it does, so it can be more useful to write comments for *why* you wrote the code - "what is it going to be used for?"

2. Adding a bit of documentation at the top of each function and/or loop can help with navigating and finding your code - "what does this function do again?"
