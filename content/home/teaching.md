### The Carpentries

I am a certified instructor for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and have taught at and assisted with workshops at the University of Minnesota, the University of Florida, and the University of California San Diego.

In addition to teaching, I am also a board member for the [UF Carpentryies Club](https://uf-carpentries.org/), which organizes workshops and other events at UF. In August 2018, we organized a series of talks, career panel, and mini-tutorials as part of [Research Bazaar at UF](https://uf-carpentry.github.io/resbaz2018/gainesville/).

### Training

I have formal training in pedagogy from completing "Teaching + Learning at the College Level", a course on evidence-based teaching practices taught by UCSD's Teaching + Learning Commons. (The course is now called ["Introduction to College Teaching"](https://commons.ucsd.edu/educators/future-faculty-programs/introduction-to-college-teaching.html).)
