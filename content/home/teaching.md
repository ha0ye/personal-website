### Computational Training

I have taught or assisted with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) workshops at the University of Minnesota, the University of Florida, and the University of California San Diego.

In addition to teaching, I was a board member for the [UF Carpentries Club](https://uf-carpentries.org/) from 2017-2019, which organizes computational workshops and related events at the University of Florida. I have also led the organization of two Research Bazaar events at UF that include: talks, panel discussions, tutorials, and more: [ResBaz2018](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/gainesville/) [ResBaz2019](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/gainesville/).

As part of the [Open Data Science at SIO](https://open-data-science-at-sio.github.io/), I also led the following informal seminars:

* [Introduction to Data Visualization and Data Wrangling in R](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-Data-Viz-Winter-2017)
* [Reproducible Research in R for Ocean Biosciences: Open-science Training Seminar](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/RRROBOTS)

### Pedagogy

I have formal training in pedagogy via "Teaching + Learning at the College Level", a course on evidence-based teaching practices taught by UCSD's Teaching + Learning Commons. (The course is now called ["Introduction to College Teaching"](https://commons.ucsd.edu/educators/future-faculty-programs/introduction-to-college-teaching.html).)

In addition, I am a [certified instructor](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/) for The Carpentries.

### Experience

I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

* [PSYC 138 (Sound and Music Perception)](http://www.psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/courses/index.html) at [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu)
* PSYC 102 (Introduction to Sensory and Perception) at [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu)<br />*this course has been replaced with "Sensory Neuroscience"*
  
* [PSYC 60 (Introduction to Statistics)](http://www.psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/courses/index.html) at [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu)
* [CS 1 (Introduction to Computer Programming)](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/course_desc#cs) at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu)
