# Biography

I'm a Postdoctoral Associate and Moore Data Fellow in the [Weecology Lab](https://www.weecology.org) at the University of Florida.

The goal of my research is to advance our understanding of how complex systems change over time, and the ways in which the driving processes manifest as changes. Although we have many hypotheses & models for ecosystem changes, as well as increasingly numerous and accessible data, bridging theory and observations remains challenging and elusive. I approach this topic through the development of methods for analyzing time series data and the application of these methods in specific systems and macro-scale analyses.

Some typical research questions are:

* What components of ecosystems are changing and how fast?
* How do different processes interact to produce patterns across temporal, spatial, and taxonomic scales?
* Which ecological properties are predictable, how well can we predict them, and what factors influence predictability?
* How can we best build causal models of complex systems, e.g. to guide forecasting and management?

I also believe that academia and higher education (in the US, but probably elsewhere) needs drastic cultural change to be more welcoming, inclusive, and accessible. Existing practices and power dynamics that support the status quo reinforce or amplify societal biases and inequities, causing harm to both the practice of science, and more importantly to the people who engage in science in any capacity. In addition to embracing open and reproducible research practices, I support changing institutional policies, improving student support and training, and continual work to understand and deconstruct biases and prejudices.
