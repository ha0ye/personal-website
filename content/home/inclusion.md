### Training

I have received training in leading Ally Skills workshops, via a "Train-the-trainers" workshop, led by Dr. Sheila Addison of [Frame Shift Consulting](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/ally-skills-workshop/) at the University of Florida.

In addition, I have attended several workshops including ally skills and bystander intervention.

### Activities

As part of the informal leadership of the [Gainesville Ally Skills Network](https://alligatorallyskills.weebly.com/), we have been educating others on the need for individuals to use their priviledge to help dismantle systems of oppression that limit inclusion and accessibility in (primarily) academic spaces.

This includes:

* 3-hour Ally Skils Workshops 
* 45-minute talks introducing concepts to broad audiences
* monthly meetings to discuss scenarios, e.g. from the [Dear Ally blog](https://dearally.com/)
